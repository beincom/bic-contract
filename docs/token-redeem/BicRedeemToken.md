# Solidity API

## BicRedeemToken

Manages the locked tokens, allowing beneficiaries to claim their tokens after a vesting period

_This contract uses OpenZeppelin's Initializable and ReentrancyGuard to provide initialization and reentrancy protection_

### ERC20Released

```solidity
event ERC20Released(address from, address beneficiary, uint256 amount, uint256 currentRewardStacks, uint256 stacks, uint64 timestamp)
```

Emitted when tokens are released to the beneficiary

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| from | address | The address of the account that executed the release |
| beneficiary | address | The address of the beneficiary who received the tokens |
| amount | uint256 | The amount of tokens released |
| currentRewardStacks | uint256 | The current stack count of rewards released |
| stacks | uint256 | The total number of stacks that will be released |
| timestamp | uint64 | The block timestamp when the release occurred |

### DENOMINATOR

```solidity
uint64 DENOMINATOR
```

The denominator used for calculating percentages, 100% = 10_000, 10% = 1_000, 1% = 100, 0.1% = 10, 0.01% = 1

_This is used to calculate the redeem rate_

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() public payable
```

_Constructor is empty and payment is disabled by default_

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address erc20Address, uint256 totalAmount, address beneficiaryAddress, uint64 durationSeconds, uint64 redeemRateNumber) public virtual
```

Initializes the contract with necessary parameters to start the vesting process

_Ensure all parameters are valid, particularly that addresses are not zero and amounts are positive_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| erc20Address | address | The ERC20 token address to be locked in the contract |
| totalAmount | uint256 | The total amount of tokens that will be locked |
| beneficiaryAddress | address | The address of the beneficiary who will receive the tokens after vesting |
| durationSeconds | uint64 | The duration of the vesting period in seconds |
| redeemRateNumber | uint64 | The rate at which the tokens will be released per duration |

### releasable

```solidity
function releasable() public view virtual returns (uint256, uint256)
```

Calculates the amount of tokens that are currently available for release

### release

```solidity
function release() public virtual
```

Allows the beneficiary to release vested tokens
